#Next Permutation On Subsegment
You need to find next and previous permutation on subsegment by O(log n). Also there are some more operations on subsegment. My solution uses Cartesian Tree. See the full task [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-XsWcDuhjdLCKgsoTcfqni_IBv5FBVTzRQmC3lnoqE/edit?usp=sharing).
